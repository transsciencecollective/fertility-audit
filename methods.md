# Methods

## Development of the Checklist
### Participant Demographics
The checklists were developed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of 25 members:

- 4 doctors
- 4 embryology staff
- 4 nursing staff
- 4 researchers 
- 2 non-clinical clinic staff
- 1 user experience designer
- 6 community members not counted in the previous categories. 

Both same-sex couples (SSCs) and transgender/non-binary (TNB) individuals were represented among the "community member" and non-"community member" participants. All team members volunteered and were recruited from personal networks.

### Determination of Items
The items on the checklist were determined drawing from a literature review as well as input from clinical and LGBTQ+ lived experiences.
From November 2023 to January 2024, multiple meetings were held with various subsets of the interdisciplinary team to iteratively refine the checklist items and, where applicable, their relative weighting.
A collaborative document was used for this purpose, allowing all members to contribute and suggest modifications. 
Ultimately, the items in the final version of the checklist were unanimously agreed upon.

## Assessment
### Survey
A survey was used to assess care providers and individual respondents in accordance with the checklist.
To reduce the time required to complete the survey, we primarily used multiple-choice questions with sparing use of free-text answers.
Questions regarding care provider practices were formatted as *Yes*/*No*/*Don't Know* questions, with the *Don't Know* option accounting for respondents who might not be aware of their clinic's processes (which itself highlights a gap in knowledge). 
Questions about whether individual respondents received training were simply formatted as *Yes*/*No* questions (as respondents would know if they have undergone training).
Confidence levels of individual respondents as well as doctors, nurses and clinical embryologists' awareness and understanding of clinical aspects were measured using Likert scales. 

Despite the emphasis on multiple-choice questions, certain checklist items necessitated free-text responses to assess knowledge without leading the respondent. 
For instance, a question examining whether doctors, embryologists, and nurses were aware of the discomfort or reluctance of TNB patients to be examined required a free-text response. 
Additionally, three questions aimed at assessing knowledge of referrals, and two questions regarding alternative uterus examination and sperm retrieval processes for transmasculine and transfeminine patients, respectively, also used free-text answers.
The full survey, along with additional details, can be found [here](./survey.md).

### Website Audit
Websites were audited according to the [rubric](./website-rubric.md) to ensure a consistent evaluation process. 
Each website was assessed in a blinded fashion by two independent reviewers. Following the individual assessments, the reviewers engaged in a discussion to reach a consensus on the evaluation of each website. 
This approach ensured that the assessments were thorough, with any discrepancies resolved through collaborative discussion.

## Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis of survey responses was conducted using the Pandas package (v1.3.3) in Python (v3.8.10). 
To compare dichotomous variables, we utilised two-tailed Fisherâ€™s exact tests.
Thematic analysis was conducted on the open-ended survey questions.
