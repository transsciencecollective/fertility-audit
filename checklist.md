# LGBTQ+ Fertility Best Practices Checklist
This checklist was developed by Sapphic Bison in collaboration with the Apricity Queer Taskforce, UCL Trans Healthcare Now and members of the wider LGBTQ+ and medical communities.

## Same-Sex (Cisgender) Couples
### High Priority
- Clinicians have been trained to work with same-sex couples (cultural competence)

- Clinicians have been trained to work with same-sex couples (medical aspects)

- Non-clinicians (including administrative staff) have been trained to work with same-sex couples (cultural competence)

- Specific clinical pathways exist for same-sex couples 

### Medium Priority
- Forms and paperwork is inclusive of same-sex couples (e.g. uses “parents” rather than “father/mother” or offers “mother/mother”/”father/father”)

- Patient guidance is inclusive of same-sex couples

## Transgender and Non-Binary Patients
### High Priority
- Clinicians have been trained to work with transgender/non-binary patients (cultural competence)

- Clinicians have been trained to work with transgender/non-binary patients (medical aspects)

- Non-clinicians (including administrative staff) have been trained to work with transgender/non-binary patients (cultural competence)

- Specific clinical pathways exist for transgender/non-binary patients

- Process for recording name and pronoun preferences

- Gender neutral treatment spaces and waiting rooms as a default (including for gynaecology/andrology services - no segregation between male and female waiting spaces)

- Alternatives to transvaginal scans offered for AFAB transgender/non-binary people (e.g. transrectal / transabdominal)

- Alternatives to masturbation offered for AMAB transgender/non-binary people (e.g. electroejaculation / surgical sperm retrieval / at-home production)

### Medium Priority
- Forms and paperwork are inclusive of transgender/non-binary people, including individuals with non-binary and other gender identities outside of “man” and “woman” (e.g. does not misgender them) - unless totally unavoidable (e.g. HFEA paperwork though HFEA has gender neutral paperwork).

- Patient guidance is gender neutral where possible and/or there is specific patient guidance for transgender/non-binary patients

- Branding of same-sex fertility services are inclusive of couples that include transgender/non-binary partners (e.g. cisgender woman + transgender woman may be referred to as “shared motherhood” but  “transgender man + transgender man” ought not be)


# What does being "culturally competent" entail?
Cultural competency training can vary between clinics and medical schools. However, we would expect as a bare minimum, any training to cover…

### Understanding LGBTQ+ Identities and Relationships
- Familiarity with different sexual orientations and gender identities. This includes the meaning of the terms “lesbian”, “gay”, “bisexual”, “transgender”, “non-binary”, “queer”, “asexual”, “intersex”, “poly”, “gender identity” and “gender dysphoria”.

### Inclusive Language and Communication
- Using inclusive terminology that acknowledges various gender identities and relationships.

- This includes not assuming all patients to be in opposite-sex relationships (e.g. not immediately assuming a woman is attending with “her husband”). It also includes asking for preferred pronouns (e.g. in sign-up forms).

- Effective communication strategies that make all patients feel comfortable (including when referring to body parts of transgender patients). This may include the use of body maps.

### Healthcare Disparities and Health Needs
- Knowledge of the specific healthcare needs of LGBTQ+ individuals (including general knowledge of different procedures transgender a patients may undergo that may impact their treatment).

- In-depth knowledge of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) suitable for LGBTQ+ individuals.

- Awareness of the unique health disparities and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in reproductive healthcare.

- Understanding of regional and national funding options available to LGBTQ+ patients. In the UK setting, this means understanding the extent to which different treatments are covered by different NHS clinical commissioning groups as well as what is needed to qualify for treatment.

### Cultural Sensitivity and Inclusion
- Promoting a nonjudgmental and affirming environment for all patients.

- Respecting preferred names and pronouns.

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Knowledge of relevant laws and regulations related to LGBTQ+ health care rights and protections.

- Understanding relevant administrative procedures and paperwork relating to parenting rights.

### Resources and Referrals
- Knowledge of LGBTQ+-friendly organisations, support groups, and community resources.

- Ability to provide referrals to LGBTQ+-competent mental health professionals or legal advisors when necessary.

- Ability to provide referrals to LGBTQ+-competent antenatal, midwifery and postnatal services.

# What does being "clinically competent" entail?

In addition to the cultural competence described above, we would expect doctors, embryologists and nurses to have the following clinical knowledge:

### Biological Implications 
- Awareness of surgical procedures that transgender people may undergo

- Awareness of variations in anatomy that may be seen in transgender patients during examination

- To be sensitive to the discomfort / reluctance in patients to be examined (e.g. pelvic floor dysfunction and vaginal atrophy in transgender men, sexual trauma)

- To understand to the impact of HRT medications on menstrual cycle / sperm production in order to prognosticate / adjust medications in fertility treatment (AND understand how these adjustments will impact transition progress in transgender individuals)  

- Awareness of alternatives to transvaginal ultrasound for transmasculine individuals (transrectal / abdominal ultrasound)

- Awareness of alternatives to masturbation for transfeminine individuals (electroejaculation / surgical sperm extraction).

### Drug Interactions 
- Awareness of medications that transgender/non-binary patients may be on and how this may affect / interact with fertility medications

- Understanding the implications of ovarian stimulation for AFAB transgender patients 

- Understanding whether different doses of medications are required when working with transgender/non-binary patients

### Psychological Impact
- Awareness that LGBTQ+ individuals undergoing fertility treatment may experience a more pronounced negative psychological impact compared to their cisgender heterosexual counterparts. These may arise from:
    - Delay to transitioning (for transgender individuals)
    - Social pressures and community perception 
    - Social isolation and therefore lack of support during treatment
